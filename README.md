# Embedded-101

# **Project Statement**

Create a temperature sensing circuit using arduino that controls the frequency of blinking of led based on temperature.

## **Pre - Requisites-**

1. Arduino
2. Arduino IDE
3. TinkerCad
4. led
5. temperature sensor
6. Breadboard
7. jumper wires

## **Simulation**

Initally we were asked to simulate the entire project using tinkercad -

Above I have attached the simulation for the above Project.

## **Coding**

I had to make multiple versions of the code to refine the code from a novice c++ code 
consisting of if else statements to a simplified more efficient version.
I have shared both the versions above

# **Documentation**

This respository wont be updated further as this is just me documenting my experience.
